# ANALYSIS OF THE CLINICAL TRIAL AND PHARMA DATASET
In today's digital world, we deal with a lot of data. This brings both opportunities and challenges for 
businesses. The increasing number of devices like smartphones and computers results in a larger amount 
of data being generated. Smart devices can provide insights into people's behaviors. To manage this 
growing volume of data, specialized tools and methods have been developed. They help collect, store, 
analyze, and show data, often in real-time. These tools let businesses find important insights hidden in 
big datasets. This era marks a transition from an Informational Society to a Knowledge-Based Society, 
where the strategic utilization of big data plays a pivotal role. (Youssra et al, 2018).
The analysis will use PySpark methods in RDDs and DataFrames, followed by SQL queries. PySpark 
is a Python library for large-scale data processing that works well with distributed systems like Apache 
Spark, allowing parallel computation across multiple nodes. It helps process extensive datasets quickly 
and efficiently. RDDs are foundational in PySpark, representing distributed object collections processed 
in parallel, with fault tolerance for seamless recovery from failures. DataFrames organize data in tabular 
form for structured manipulation. SQL, a common language for database operations, allows analysts to 
query, filter, and aggregate data efficiently. PySpark enhances SQL operations by offering an SQL 
interface for RDDs and DataFrames.
